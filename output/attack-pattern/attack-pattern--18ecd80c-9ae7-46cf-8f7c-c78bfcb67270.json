Operations that conceal sponsorship  may maintain visible falsified groups, news outlets, non-profits, or other organizations, but seek  to mislead or obscure the identity sponsoring, funding, or otherwise supporting these entities.  \nInfluence operations may use a variety of techniques to mask the location of their social media  accounts to complicate attribution and conceal evidence of foreign interference. Operation  accounts may set their location to a false place, often the location of the operation\u2019s target  audience, and post in the region\u2019s language",
