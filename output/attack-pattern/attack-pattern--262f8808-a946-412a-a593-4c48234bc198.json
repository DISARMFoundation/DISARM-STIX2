Services may include web hosting, file sharing, and email distribution.  Bulletproof hosting refers to services provided by an entity, such as a domain hosting or web  hosting firm, that allows its customer considerable leniency in use of the service. An influence  operation may utilize bulletproof hosting to maintain continuity of service for suspicious, illegal,  or disruptive operation activities that stricter hosting services would limit, report, or suspend.
